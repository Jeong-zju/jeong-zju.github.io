<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Master's student in Control Science and Engineering at Zhejiang University, advised by [Prof. Qinyuan Ren](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0008668). I am passionate about robotics, with a focus on making robots robust in dynamic, unstructured environments. My research combines control, planning, and reinforcement learning to enable autonomous systems that work reliably in the real world.

My work emphasizes cross-disciplinary collaboration, as seen in my internship at ETH Zurich's [Computational Robotics Lab](https://crl.ethz.ch/index.html)(CRL) with [Dr. Yijiang Huang](https://yijiangh.github.io/). I thrive in environments that mix mechanical design, control, and AI, and I'm passionate about mentoring juniors and fostering inclusive academic spaces. I'm applying to PhD programs to advance reliable robotic systems for dynamic, unstructured environments.

Feel free to contact me through email!

# üìö Research Interests
My current research focuses on developing reliable robotic systems capable of operating in cluttered environments and adapting to changes in real-time. Specifically, I am interested in the intersection of:
- ü§ñ **Robotics**: Autonomous manipulation, task-and-motion planning, mobile robots, legged robots
- üèóÔ∏è **Control Systems**: Hybrid force-position control, human-robot interaction
- üß† **Machine Learning**: Reinforcement learning, imitation learning, data-driven control

I aim to advance the field by developing robots that can understand and adapt to dynamic environments, including human-robot interaction in assistive living, sports, and construction applications.
